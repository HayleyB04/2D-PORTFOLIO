# 2D Portfolio

This is a 2D game that showcases some of my programming skills and highlights from my portfolio.

## Description

Inspired by JSLegendDev, I created a 2D game to showcase my portfolio. It uses Kaboom.js which is a Javascript library that can be used to program games. I utilised my JavaScript knowledge, learnt how to use Tiled to create game maps, and explored camera scaling, animations and dialogue text.

## Executing program

Take the content of the dist folder and drag and drop it to your favorite static site hosting provider.

## Help
